=== Enhancement Added: Search Box

==== Justification

An efficient search algorithm is needed for students to locate contacts speedily and conveniently.
The previous design of `find` command greatly reduces speed of search by requiring user to type `enter`
with (almost) exactly matching keywords.

The search box solves this issue by responding to user input in real time.
The prefix matching rule is designed to specially suit this real time response, allowing users to find contacts
even if they do not remember their full names.

Furthermore, the search box is more powerful because it searches for name, phone and tag in one textfield. This makes
searching integrated and thus convenient for the user.

=== Enhancement Proposed: Add support for foreign languages

NUS has a lot of international students. It is important to allow CRUD in languages other than English to cater to these students'
needs. Moreover, UI should be able to display in other languages.

=== Enhancement Proposed: Add support for phone country code

NUS is a tertiary institution with global impact. A student in it will come across foreign numbers that needs saving.

=== Enhancement Proposed: Add support for phone number tags

As almost all modern address applications do, multiple phones should be able to be differentiated according to their uses,
for example `work` phone and `home` phone.

=== Other contributions

* Allow for empty values in email and address (Pull request https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T14-B1/main/pull/20[#20])
* Suggest the allowance for empty values in other fields implemented thereafter
* Suggest enhancements of custom fields and multiple phone numbers which were later implemented by teammates
* Point out an issue in the original developer guide's sample enhancement about Storage (issue https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/708[#708])
